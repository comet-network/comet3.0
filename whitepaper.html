        <h3>Co-met Network</h3>
        <p align="justify">Co-met Network is a morden form of crypto currency and an influential system that has an innovative ideas and
            concepts to provide gamified experience for all users by allowing them to start mining, regardless of
            technical aptitude and fully participate in the new crypto currency economy. The view of Co-met Network is
            to provide each miner a simple, secure and robust experience.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>

        <p align="justify">Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currency decentralized and not controlled by any government.
            The history of cryptocurrencies can be traced back to the 1980s, when they were called cyber currencies.
            These coins started gaining popularity in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin, which was created by an
            anonymous programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Since the launch of Bitcoin in
            2009, cryptocurrencies have been all the rage. Over the past few years, their popularity has only grown,
            with more and more people investing in them. Currently, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency with over
            a millions users. Other popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Dash, which have
            been taking over the financial world.</p>

        <p align="justify">Beyond releasing new coins into circulation, mining is central to crypto's security. It verifies and secures
            the blockchain, which allows cryptocurrencies to function as a peer-to-peer decentralized network without
            any need for oversight from a third party. And it creates the incentive for miners to contribute their
            computing power to the network.</p>

        <p align="justify">We know that cryptocurrency mining can be very profitable if done right with the correct mindset. Mining is a
            safest way of investing in cryptocurrencies alongside balancing and diversifying a crypto portfolio. One of
            the advantages of mining is that it makes it more challenging for new investors to become victims of the
            temptation of gambling, panic, fear, or market manipulation. This suggests that mining is the best way to
            start investing in cryptocurrencies. Therefore, CO-MET Network is set to make mining as easy as possible and
            cost-saving and energy-saving.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Free mining app</h4>
        <p align="justify">Co-met Network is a new crypto currency has an innovative ideas and aim to simplify user experience in crypto
            currencies economy. Co-met Network is a modern mobile mining solution, uses cloud-based mining therefore it
            uses minimal battery. The best part of the concept is that it is entirely free to get started and mine
            Co-met (just download our app) for as long as the supply last. </p>

        <p align="justify">The Co-met application gives users the ability to mine Co-met coin free on a smart phone with just a click.
            Users can now get the cryptocurrency every 24 hours on Android and iOS apps. The only requirement is to
            check into the app and click to activate the mining process. There is no need of any special hardware. It is
            completely free for everyone.</p>

        <p align="justify">our aims is to provide free mining to increase adoption rate of cryptocurrency all over the world. With the
            Co-met network mining app, users receives mining rewards by contributing to the network. Co-met Network
            application is free to download and use, users also have the opportunity to be rewarded in a growing asset
            without investing from their own pockets.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>CO-MET Network Vision</h4>

        <p align="justify">Co-met Network's vision is to establish an open internet platform and an ecosysteam of Decentralized
            application for that we are committed to utilizing blockchain technology. We will also progressively
            introduce mobile games, social network, e-commerce payment, and lifestyle services with the ultimate goal of
            turning every userâ€™s role as the platformâ€™s consumer, contributor and value owners at the same time.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4>Payment</h4>

        <p align="justify">The Co-met Network development team is working on building an easy-to-use wallet mobile app, integrated with
            WalletConnect, to ensure secure storage of keys, and seamless mechanism to connect browser-based DApps to
            the mobile app. Users can interact with DApps on browsers and in the future many more devices, while still
            keeping their keys secure in their mobile wallet.</p>

        <p align="justify">Vision of Co-met Network is to provide an interface for users and payment APIs and SDKs for DApps, merchant,
            and users to instantly accept or pay in crypto assets. Our aim is to make the crypto payment process very
            simple and easy for anyone regardless of technical aptitude to fully participate in the cryptocurrency
            economy.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Roles in Co-met Network</h4>

        <p align="justify">There is currently only one role in the Network, the role of Miner which describes the individual that uses
            the app in order to earn Co-met coin.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Miner</h4>

        <p align="justify">Co-met Network miner whose job is to confirm that he/she is basically not a â€œrobotâ€ daily. This user
            validates his/her presence every day as he/she must open the app every 24 hours to continue earning Co-met
            coins. A Miner can make the base rate of 2 Co-met coins per hour, which can be broken down to 1, 0.5, 0.25,
            0.1 in line with the user base growth. Hence, it is always important to get started now before the base rate
            is halved. By logging into the mobile app every 24 hours and clicking the mining button, users participate
            in the gamified mining experience. Unlike many mining platforms, there is no need for a vast amount of
            energy to mine.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Referral</h4>

        <p align="justify">The person referring a new player gets a 25% boost to their mining rate. The new miner has the option to
            enter a referral code at the time of creating their account. While this is not mandatory, it is advised as
            the new user receives 10 Co-met coin for using a friendâ€™s referral code. The concept of referral proposes
            the ability of miners to authenticate new players, since each player contributes equally to the networkâ€™s
            security and stability.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Core Team</h4>

        <p align="justify">The Co-met Network core team is composed of experts with specialism in internet & blockchain technology,
            mathematics & cryptography experts.
            we are in progress of forming Co-met Foundation. We will announce the list of core team members and advisors
            upon the establishment of the foundation. As the Foundation and the core team own 20% of the total issued
            Co-met Coins as development reward, these Co-met will be also be allocated to project sponsors and the
            further build-up of Co-met Network ecosystem</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Road map details</h4>

        <p align="justify">The project has been structured in four phases in order to create an easy-to-understand overview of the
            development plan from the team.</p>
